# The weekly programming challenge

# Aim and scope
The only goal I had when I started this challenge was to improve my coding skills. Rankings of scripts is done only to highlight the good points of each code. There are three rank category: 
  * Readability: simplicity, readability, flatness of code.
  * Speed: all code must be benchmarked using *rbenchmark*.
  * Aesthetic of output: mainly figures and table.
