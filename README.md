# The weekly programming challenge

# Aim and scope
The only goal I had when I started this challenge was to improve my coding skills. Rankings of scripts is done only to highlight the good points of each code. There are three rank categories: 
  * Readability: simplicity, readability, flatness of code.
  * Speed: all code must be benchmarked using *rbenchmark*.
  * Aesthetic of output: mainly figures and table.
Apart from speed, rank categories are subjective. Each participants in the challenge will select one script per category, the one considered the best in that category by the participant.
