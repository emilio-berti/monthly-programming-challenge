# The monthly programming challenge

# Aim and scope
Some of us are good are making readable code, some of us are good at making fast code, and some of us are good at making beautiful figures and tables. The goal of the challenges is to become good at all of them. For each challenge the scripts are ranked. The rankings is done only to highlight the good points of each script; there is no judgment here. There are three rank categories: 
  * Speed: all code is benchmarked using *rbenchmark* by a single participant on a specific machine for each challenge.
  * Readability: simplicity, readability, flatness of code.
  * Aesthetic of output: mainly figures and table.
  
Apart from speed, rank categories are subjective. Each participant in the challenge will select one script per category, the one considered the best in that category by the participant. 

# Instructions
Each challenge is posted as an Issue in the GitHub repository https://github.com/emilio-berti/monthly-programming-challenge/issues. To participate, simply post in the reply the script.**txt** file with your code. Each challenge starts on the first day of the month and ends the last day. To propose a challenge, simply open a new issue on a Monday morning; if you do not provide data, be sure to set a random seed for results to be the same. There are no limits to the number of challenges that can be proposed every Monday. To be comparable, I (or a single person) will bechmark all scripts on a single machine. For the other two rankings to be objective, you are very welcome to express your preference on one script per category. Each Monday I will circulate a poll to participants for voting closed challenges. This may look like judgment of quality of scripts, but it is not; readability and aesthetic pleasure are subjective concepts, and it is readable what most of the people can read easily, and beautiful what most the people found it so. The rankings will help us in understanding what is that the majority thinks.

# Difficulty
Each challenge has a tag describing the level of difficulty of the challenge, assigned by me according to my own judgment. Keep in mind that what I found difficult may not be difficult to you, and *vice versa*. 

# Topics
All topics are more than welcome and all participants are encouraged to propose a challenge. There is only one restriction to challenges: there must be at least another participant able to reply.

# Why all these rules?
To avoid chaos. If you have suggestions or complaints please contact me. Finally, remember rule 1 of this club: you *DO* talk about the monthly programming challenge club.

# Updates
I was a bit busy finishing up my PhD, so the challenge stalled for several months. I decided most of us do not have time to approach a weekly or two-weekly challenge and I decided to make it monthly, which is easier also for me. New challenges coming up soon!
