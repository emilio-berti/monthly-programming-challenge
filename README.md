# The weekly programming challenge

# Aim and scope
Some of us are good are making readable code, some of us are good at making fast code, and some of us are good at making beautiful figures and tables. The goal of the challenges is to become good at all of them. For each challenge the scripts are ranked. The rankings is done only to highlight the good points of each script; there is no judgment here. There are three rank categories: 
  * Speed: all code is benchmarked using *rbenchmark* by a single participant on a specific machine for each challenge.
  * Readability: simplicity, readability, flatness of code.
  * Aesthetic of output: mainly figures and table.
  
Apart from speed, rank categories are subjective. Each participant in the challenge will select one script per category, the one considered the best in that category by the participant. 

# Instructions
Each challenge is posted as an Issue in the GitHub repository https://github.com/emilio-berti/weekly-programming-challenge/issues.
