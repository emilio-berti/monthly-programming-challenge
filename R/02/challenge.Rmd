We want to understand which factors determine the quality (*quality*) of the vinho verde from white grapes. The data to investigate this is archived at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv. A description of the dataset is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality.

# Instructions
1. write your solution in a script.**txt** file and attach it as a reply to this issue.
2. There is no package restriction

## Creation of the dataframe 
```{r dataset summary, include=TRUE}
d <- read.csv("winequality-white.csv", sep = ";")
str(d)
hist(d$quality, #we want to model this
     col = "grey80",
     main = "",
     xlab = "Quality") 
```
