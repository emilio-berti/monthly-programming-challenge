# Challenge

We have a dataframe called *dat* on which we want to perform a linear regression. The dataframe has 5 columns: *y* is the reponse variable, and *A*, *B*, *C*, and *D* the predictors. In addition to run the regression, we want to test the collinearity of predicotrs, the model assumptions, and present the results of the regression (coefficients estimate +/- standard errors) in the way you feel more appropriate. All variables are randomly drawn from a standard normal distribution, so there is no need to scale them.

# Instructions
1. copy paste the code below to create the dataframe
2. write your solution in a script.**txt** file and attach it as a reply to this issue.
4. There is no package restriction

## Creation of the dataframe 
```{r create dataframe, include=TRUE}
set.seed(666) #our favourite seed
dat <- as.data.frame(matrix(rnorm(100 * 5), ncol = 5))
names(dat) <- c('y', LETTERS[1:4])
```
