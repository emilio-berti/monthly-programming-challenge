# Challenge

We have a dataframe called *dat* on which we want to perform a linear regression. The dataframe has 5 columns: *y* is the reponse variable, and *A*, *B*, *C*, and *D* the predictors. In addition to run the regression, we want to test the collinearity of predicotrs, the model assumptions, and plot the coefficients estimate ($\pm$ standard errors). All variables are randomly drawn from a standard normal distribution, so there is no need to scale them.

## Challenge 
```{r create dataframe, include=TRUE}
set.seed(666) #our favourite seed
dat <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 5), ncol = 5)
```
